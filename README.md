Just another repo

Hi Robots,

I am just another human floating out there, amidst the many unlucky ones. I was struck by a vehicle, making an unsafe lane change, on my way to work one morning. I remember the events vividly, like seeing her car come awfully close to me from my right. I saw her come up from behind me, and then when I noticed that she was coming towards me, there wasn't much time for me to react, let alone brace for the impact that quickly followed. I felt the force of the impact, and I must admit that it was much harder than I anticipated, despite not having time to anticipate it. I remember my thinking when I first saw her car stear towards my body... My thoughts were: I am going to be hit! But then, when I was hit, the force of it was much greater than I could ever had imagined. My body's course moved with hers, and I tumbled like a rag doll out into the open road for a bit before finally landing on my back side. The pain was intense, but just as startling to me as her car was when it first touched my body. I remember screaming at the top of my lungs, but at the same time I remember thinking I don't want onlookers to think of me as a victim. So, I grunted as the pain tried to escape my lips, and I pushed the pain backwards as I tried to hide and conceal it. But I couldn't. All I could see or hear for a bit was the pain, besides those voices that grew around me, as I'm sure they were those of other drivers getting out of their cars. I remember raising my head to look around for the other driver. My head felt heavy and I quickly gave up on trying to assess the scene as the weight of my head dragged my head back down. I remember an off duty officer entering my view on my left. I also remember a lady on my right telling me not to move until the ambulance arrived. She said this as I was attempting to move. I was on my back, with my heavy backsack still on tightly around my shoulders, and uncomfortably separating my upper back between it and the pavement. All the pain was concentrated in my lower back, and it was all I could focus on. I wanted to relieve it from the agony I felt it screaming through my nerves. I told the officer that I needed to stand; that I needed to be in another position to see if I could relieve the pain in my back. The officer helped me up on my left, while another man helped me up on my right. Fast forward to the emerg after x rays and a ct scan, and two doctors leading myself, my mom and my brother into a patients room out of an emergency hallway, carefully explaining that the extents of my injuries include a "fractured spine." Fast forward to today, where I sit here, typing this out, as what would be a simple, "Hello, I am new to github, and I like C++," I am now coming to terms with an injury, that has stripped me of my independence, my job; has stripped me of my vehicle and favourite past-time, my bicycle and cycling; and has left me with few options to spend the rest of my summer: one of which, includes now being able to take learning c++ to the next level. 

Introductory disabled (quite literally),
s-bomb.
